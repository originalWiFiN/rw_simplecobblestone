"Simply Cobblestone" mod for RimWorld<br>
Features:
* Chunks can be broken down into cobblestone resource of appropriate stuff. Bills can be set on a crafting spot and the stonecutting table. it's faster than cutting stone blocks, but yields less construction material.
* Assorted cobblestone can be mixed into mixed cobblestone, similar to patchwork leather.
* Cobblestone and stone blocks can be smelted into vitified stone blocks in the electric smelter. The pipeline is faster than stonecutting, but the resulting blocks are more brittle.  
* New structure - cobblestone wall. Slower to build and has less health that stone block walls.
* New surface - cobblestone floor. Slow to build, but can be placed on otherwise unusable surfaces like soft sand.

Things to fix:
* Cobblestone floors and walls don't inherit "stuff" color

Things to add:
* Add bill for "make any cobblestone"
* specify filter for mixed cobblestone and vitrified stone blocks bills
* add "throwning stones" weapon
* add cobblestone fence - works like basic fence, slower to build, brittle, but gives better cover
